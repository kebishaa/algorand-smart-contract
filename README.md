# About
Client 10 Academy: wanted to overcome the challenge of ensuring that certificates are available to all trainees in a secure way, and (if possible) that certificate holders can benefit from smart contracts actions now and in the future. Currently, the training certificates are handed to trainees as simple PDF files, which prevents third parties like employers from performing vital steps of authentication.

To systematically tackle this problem 10 Academy has partnered with Algorand to use the Algorand Blockchain as the foundation element of the NFT. Therefore, the main aim of this project is to build an end-to-end Web3 dapp on the Algorand Blockchain which will help 10 Academy to generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs) as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform predefined actions.
# Objectives
The major objective behind this types of systems based on the blockchain technology is to enble trust minimizaed and user controlled internet. This project exploits the immutable feature of the blockchain technology to elimainate fraudulent certificate possesions in academic systems. This system will enable 10 Academy to give an NFT based certificate for its trainees after the successful completion of the training program where any one can vertify whether the certificates were obtained legally.
